**Banking System Program Description**

The program simulates a simple banking system that allows users to perform various banking operations such as opening new accounts, checking account information, withdrawing and depositing amounts, and checking balance information.

**Classes and Functions:**

1. **BankingSystem Class:**
   - This class encapsulates all the functionalities related to the banking system.
   - Private data members include accountNumber, mobileNumber, balance, newBalance, amount, name, address, email, choice, and continueChoice.
   - Public member functions include:
     - `openNewAccount`: Opens a new bank account for a customer, taking inputs such as account number, name, address, mobile number, and email. It also allows the customer to deposit an initial amount.
     - `displayAccountInfo`: Displays account information such as name, account number, and balance.
     - `withdrawAmount`: Allows customers to withdraw funds from their accounts.
     - `depositAmount`: Allows customers to deposit funds into their accounts.
     - `displayBalanceInfo`: Displays the balance information of an account.
     - `checkAccountExistence`: Checks if an account exists based on the provided account number.

2. **Main Function:**
   - The main function serves as the entry point of the program.
   - It initializes variables and objects needed for the banking system.
   - It presents a menu-driven interface to the user, allowing them to choose from various banking operations.
   - Depending on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate member functions of the `BankingSystem` class to perform the desired operation.
   - The program continues executing until the user chooses to exit.

**Execution Flow:**

1. The program starts by displaying a welcome message and a menu of banking operations.
2. Based on the user's choice, it either opens a new account, displays account information, performs withdrawals or deposits, checks balance information, or exits the program.
3. For each operation that requires user input (e.g., opening an account, withdrawing/depositing funds), the program prompts the user for relevant information.
4. The program maintains an array of `BankingSystem` objects to manage multiple accounts simultaneously.
5. Error handling is implemented for scenarios such as invalid input and insufficient funds.

**Enhancements and Considerations:**

1. The program could be enhanced by adding features such as account deletion, account statement generation, and transaction history tracking.
2. Input validation can be improved to handle edge cases more robustly, ensuring the program's reliability.
3. Exception handling mechanisms can be incorporated to gracefully handle runtime errors.
4. Additional security measures, such as password protection and encryption, can be implemented to enhance data security.

Overall, the program provides a basic yet functional framework for managing banking operations, demonstrating the principles of object-oriented programming and user interaction in C++.
